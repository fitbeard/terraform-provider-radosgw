# radosgw_s3_bucket_acl

Manages the ACL (Access Control List) for an S3 bucket in Ceph RadosGW. This resource allows you to set canned ACLs on buckets and tracks drift when the ACL is changed outside of Terraform.

~> **Important:** This resource can only manage ACLs for buckets owned by the user configured in the provider. The S3 API restricts ACL operations to the bucket owner only - even admin credentials cannot manage ACLs on buckets owned by other users. If you need to manage ACLs on buckets with different owners, you must use separate provider configurations (aliases) with each owner's credentials.

~> **Note:** When destroying this resource, the bucket ACL is reset to `private`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage ACL for an existing bucket
resource "radosgw_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"
}

resource "radosgw_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = radosgw_s3_bucket.example.bucket
  acl    = "private"
}

# Set public-read ACL on a bucket
resource "radosgw_s3_bucket" "public" {
  bucket = "my-public-bucket"
}

resource "radosgw_s3_bucket_acl" "public" {
  bucket = radosgw_s3_bucket.public.bucket
  acl    = "public-read"
}

# Set public-read-write ACL on a bucket
resource "radosgw_s3_bucket" "public_rw" {
  bucket = "my-public-rw-bucket"
}

resource "radosgw_s3_bucket_acl" "public_rw" {
  bucket = radosgw_s3_bucket.public_rw.bucket
  acl    = "public-read-write"
}

# Set authenticated-read ACL on a bucket
resource "radosgw_s3_bucket" "auth_read" {
  bucket = "my-auth-read-bucket"
}

resource "radosgw_s3_bucket_acl" "auth_read" {
  bucket = radosgw_s3_bucket.auth_read.bucket
  acl    = "authenticated-read"
}
```
