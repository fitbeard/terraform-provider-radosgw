  Retrieves information about IAM access keys associated with the specified RadosGW user. Use this data source to get S3 and/or Swift access keys for a user.
  Note: The RadosGW API also returns active and create_date fields, but these are not yet exposed by the go-ceph library. They will be added in a future version when go-ceph supports them.

# radosgw_iam_access_keys

Retrieves information about IAM access keys associated with the specified RadosGW user. Use this data source to get S3 and/or Swift access keys for a user.

**Note:** The RadosGW API also returns `active` and `create_date` fields, but these are not yet exposed by the go-ceph library. They will be added in a future version when go-ceph supports them.

**Note:** Listing multiple S3 keys per user requires Ceph Squid (19.x) or higher. Older versions (Reef 18.x) may have issues when multiple keys exist.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get all access keys (S3 and Swift) for a user
data "radosgw_iam_access_keys" "all" {
  user_id = radosgw_iam_user.example.user_id
}

# Get only S3 access keys
data "radosgw_iam_access_keys" "s3_only" {
  user_id  = radosgw_iam_user.example.user_id
  key_type = "s3"
}

# Get only Swift access keys
data "radosgw_iam_access_keys" "swift_only" {
  user_id  = radosgw_iam_user.example.user_id
  key_type = "swift"
}

# Reference user resource
resource "radosgw_iam_user" "example" {
  user_id      = "example-user"
  display_name = "Example User"
}

# Output all access keys
output "all_access_keys" {
  description = "All access keys for the user"
  value       = data.radosgw_iam_access_keys.all.access_keys
}

# Output S3 access key IDs only
output "s3_access_key_ids" {
  description = "S3 access key IDs for the user"
  value       = [for key in data.radosgw_iam_access_keys.s3_only.access_keys : key.access_key_id]
}

# Output Swift access key IDs only
output "swift_access_key_ids" {
  description = "Swift access key IDs for the user"
  value       = [for key in data.radosgw_iam_access_keys.swift_only.access_keys : key.access_key_id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `user_id` - (Required) The user ID to retrieve access keys for.


* `key_type` - (Optional) Filter by key type. Valid values: `s3`, `swift`. If not specified, returns both S3 and Swift keys.




## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `access_keys` - List of access keys associated with the user. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_keys))
* `id` - The data source identifier (same as user_id).
* `user_id` - See Argument Reference above.
* `key_type` - See Argument Reference above.

### Nested Schema for `access_keys`



- `access_key_id` (String) The access key ID. For S3 keys this is the access key. For Swift keys this is `user_id:subuser`.
- `key_type` (String) The type of key: `s3` or `swift`.
- `user` (String) The user or subuser ID associated with this key. For S3 keys this is the user ID. For Swift keys this is `user_id:subuser`.
